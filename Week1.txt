       13. They explain the purpose of a section of code or why they chose to write a section of code the  way they did. These notes are meant for human readers, not the interpreter.
       
       14. Because it is a human that will review and update the program , so your code should be readable and easy to understand.

       15. 
	• NameError : using a variable that is not defined

	• ValueError : raised when the wrong value is assigned to an object

	• ZeroDivisionError : division by zero (when divisor is 0)
 
	• IndentationError : when the spaces and tabs are not placed properly 

	• OverflowError : when the data type used to store data was not large enough to hold the data

	• SyntaxError : using invalid syntax in code
 
	• TypeError : when the data type of an object in an operation is inappropriate

    

       16.
	#1 , #2 , #3 : No error occurs

	#4 : Since the division operator has high precedence , its better to create a vriable called "sum" and divide it by 2 . (Logic Error)

	#5 : No error occurs

	#6 : (ZeroDivision Error)

	#7 : The syntax of Python does not allow n1*n2 to appear on the left side of the assignment operator. (Syntax Error)
	
	#8 : No error occurs

       19.
	(a) Because the formula is written before getting the value of r , so the circumference of the circle is calculated with r = 0
	(b) Writing C = 2*PI*r after getting the radius from the user


       20. Write a Python program that gets 2 number and and performs four main operations
	
	num1 = float(input("Please enter the first number  : "))
	num2 = float(input("Please enter the second number : "))
	add = num1 + num2
	sub = num1 - num2
	mul = num1 * num2
	div = num1 / num2
	print(add)
	print(sub)
	print(mul)
	print(div)


       21. Write a Python program that concatenates 2 strings

	str1 = input("String 1 : ")
	str2 = input("String 2 : ")
	str = str1 + str2
	print("Concatenated two diffrent strings : " , str)
